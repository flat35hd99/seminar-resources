# Check your environment

 - What OS do you use ?
   - I expect you to use windows.
 - Is GitHub desktop installed ?
 - Do you have GitHub account ?

# Commit

 - Git is a tool to manage change history by recording difference.
 - `commit` is a command to save diff and a unit of save.
 - It is important to `commit` frequently and give `commit` a name.

# Branch - concept

[Git Branch - Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches)

> The diagram above(right) visualizes a repository with two isolated lines of development, one for a little feature, and one for a longer-running feature. By developing them in branches, itâ€™s not only possible to work on both of them in parallel, but it also keeps the main master branch free from questionable code.

# Branch - usage

In situation
 - to debug
 - to develop new features

How to use
1. using `branch` command, make new branch by default branch 
2. change current branch to made branch in step 1
3. work and `commit`.
4. `merge` to default branch.

---

# Branch - commands

```shell
> git branch feature/random
> git checkout feature/random
```

this is same below

```shell
> git checkout -b feature/random
```

work something and commit them.

```
> git checkout main
```

`main` branch is default branch in this case.

```
> git merge feature/random
```

---
# Push

 - `commit` command save diffs on local.
 - You can save them to remote by `push` command.
 - Git can have multiple remote. Every remote should be named.
 - `push` command require remote name.

---

# Let's Get Started !!

## init
1. Open explorer
2. Create a folder named `random-generator` wherever you like.
3. Open Github Desktop and click `File` tab.
   1. Click `Add local Repository`

These proccesses is same as simple commands below

```
> cd random-generator
> git init
```

---

## Create file and Commit.
1. Open `random-generator` Folder by Editor(Visual Studio Code, Atom, Vim, Emacs). You can do that via clicking button in GitHub Desktop.
2. Create file named `random.c`
3. Copy and Paste this code.
4. Open GitHub Desktop and check your changes.
   1. `random.c` is marked green plus. It mean a new file.
   2. Green lines is added lines.

---

5. You may see `Create random.c` message at the bottom left. It is `commit message`. `commit message` should simply describe the commit. `git log` command show this part and you will know what the commit is by the `commit message`.
   1. `Description` is also `commit message` but they are displayed on the second and subsequent lines.
   2. Fill in these text box and Click `Commit to main`.

```
> git add random.c
> git commit -m "Create random.c"
```

---

## Push to remote(GitHub)
1. Click `Publish repository`
2. Check `Keep this code private` is checked.
3. Click `Publish repository` button.
4. Check https://github.com/USERNAME/random-generator

```
> git add origin github.com/USERNAME/random-generator
> git push origin main
```

---

## Problems

1. Number of iterations is hard coding. We want to specify the number of repetitions from keyboard input during program execution.
2. The signals of `start` and `end` does not have newline character. It looks not good.
---

## Create branch
Next, we will add process to enter a number. It is new feature, so we create new branch.
1. Open `Branch` tab at the top of window.
2. Click `New branch` and input `feature/input_repetition`
3. then, Click `Create branch`

```
> git branch feature/input_repetition
> git checkout feature/input_repetition
```
or 
```
> git checkout -b feature/input_repetition
```

---

## write something

1. Copy and paste this code and save.
2. Write `commit message`
3. Commit by clicking `Commit to feature/input_repetition`

---

## Question

If change branch to `main`, what will be happen ?

---

## Answer

the code in `random` function disappeared.

Why ?

---

## Create another branch
you can merge from `feature/input_repetition` into `main` but in this exrcise we start creating formatting feature.

Note: in practice, It's better to merge first, and then create branch.

1. Checkout to main branch.
2. Create `feature/format` branch and checkout to it.
3. Change code.
   1. `\n` is newline character.

---

## Merge
To integrate changes into `main` branch, we use `merge`

1. Open `Current branch` and checkout to `main`
   1. Note: You have to change current branch to destination branch.
   2. In this case, we integrate changes on `feature/input_repetetion` branch into `main` branch. So, the current branch have to `main` branch.
2. Reopen `Current branch` and `Choose a branch to merge into main`
3. Choose `feature/input_repetetion` and hogehoge
4. Check that codes is changed.
5. Repeat process above to merge `feature/format` branch's change into `main` branch.

---

## Merge (commands)

commands (I think you've already noticed, using Git via CLI is simple and easy way.)

```
> git checkout main
> git merge feature/input_repetition
> git merge feature/format
```

---
## Push again

Push a great code to remote.

```
> git push origin main
```

and check your page on github.com
