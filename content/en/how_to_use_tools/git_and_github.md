## Install Git
If your machine's OS is Windows, you can install Git via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). You can install only Git via [official installer](https://git-scm.com/book/ja/v2/%E4%BD%BF%E3%81%84%E5%A7%8B%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B-Git%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB) but it is only command line interface(CLI) and install process have a little dificulity. I recommend you to use GUI first, so We use GitHub Desktop.

1. Access [the site](https://desktop.github.com/), download installer file.
2. Click installer file to install app.
3. Click `Sign in to GitHub.com`. Browser will be appeared. Click `Authorize desktop`. This allow app to access your GitHub data.
4. Click some button to return app.
5. You meybe see `Configure Git` page in app. `Email` is configured github's sample email address, so Select your GitHub email address.
6. Click Finish.

Congraturation! You have finished. Start manage repository by Git!

Next page, you start using Git and GitHub.
